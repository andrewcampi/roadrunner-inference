## ✨ What is RoadRunner?

**RoadRunner** is a high-efficiency inference engine for transformer models like GPT-2 and LLaMA-3.2-1B. It bypasses large matrix multiplications in MLP blocks and LM heads using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **adaptive residual routing** — all while preserving near-perfect output quality.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **SVD-Based Routing**: Decomposes MLP weight matrices to create efficient, low-rank computation paths.
- **Token Embedding Alignment**: Shows transformer hidden states naturally align with correct token embeddings (>0.99 cosine similarity).
- **Matrix-Free LM Head**: Replaces expensive vocabulary projection with lightweight dot-product prediction and reranking.
- **Layerwise Alpha Blending**: Uses minimal routing contributions (as low as 5%) to maintain output fidelity.
