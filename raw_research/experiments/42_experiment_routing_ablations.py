""" Analysis:
What You’ve Now Proven
✅ Your routing stack is stable, repeatable, and functionally correct
✅ The failure cases are due to latent alignment, not system randomness
✅ There’s no regression from cosine or residual modes — and small gains are possible

🧠 What’s Not Wrong
✅ The code works as designed:

FAISS index builds properly

Projections are correct (h @ Vh)

Normalization behaves

Residual logic is applied accurately

Drift scoring + reranking are consistent

So the pipeline is sound, stable, and repeatable.

🔍 What’s Actually Limiting It (Revealed by Results)
Even though the code is working, the representation it's operating on is misaligned — which leads to:

❌ Drift is still high for 8/9 tokens
Despite trying:

Cosine similarity

Residual matching

Better scaling during rerank

This tells us the root problem isn’t distance metric or vector magnitude — it’s semantic mismatch in the latent space.

🎯 So What’s “Wrong” Isn’t the Code, It’s the Projection Target
You're routing in the wrong space.
You're doing:

python
Copy
Edit
code = h @ Vh   # from W_proj (output side of MLP)
But h doesn’t actually live in the row space of W_proj.

That’s like trying to match apples to oranges by projecting the apple into orange-space.

The deeper you go in the network:

The less h resembles W_proj's input space

So h @ Vh puts you far from any valid MLP output, even if your logic is flawless

🔁 Analogy
Imagine your FAISS index is a map of cities in Europe, and your query vector (h @ Vh) is a GPS coordinate from somewhere in Asia.

No matter how fast or clever your search algorithm is:

You're just searching in the wrong country.

✅ What You Revealed Is Missing
A better projection basis

Or a better code space where h and mlp(h) are closer aligned

Possibly: some light transformation between h → code, using fc, residuals, or a fixed autoencoder

And that’s exactly the next frontier — not fixing bugs, but aligning representations.

TL;DR
Nothing is broken — but you're projecting from a latent space (h) into a space (Vh) it wasn't designed to live in.

That mismatch is what causes:

Most tokens to miss

High drift, even with reranking

Consistent 1-token hits (because a few tokens do accidentally land close)

The code is correct. The math is legal. The alignment is off.
