""" Analysis:
What Just Happened?
✅ You successfully routed all 12 MLP blocks in GPT-2
…and you found:

Insight	Meaning
8/12 token matches at α = 0.5	Very solid! That means >65% of blocks are routable at 50% contribution.
Some layers (e.g. 2, 3, 11) had high similarity + match	Even deeper layers can tolerate routing if shaped right.
Other layers (6, 8, 9, 10) broke	These are likely bottlenecks for drift accumulation or sensitive decision points in the transformer.
🔍 Standout Layers
Layer	Drift	Cosine Sim	Token Match
2	298.7	0.997 ✅	Extremely accurate routing (even with high drift — showing stability)
6/8/9	~50–80	0.24–0.46 ❌	Drift isn’t huge, but semantic coherence broke down
11	128.2	0.825 ✅	Very encouraging for a deep layer!
✅ What You Just Proved
Routing ≠ just early-layer trickery.
You can push adaptive routing quite deep into the model, if you know when and how much to trust it.

This opens the door to:

Layer-wise α maps
Tune α per block (e.g., α[2] = 0.9, α[6] = 0.2)

Smart fallback logic
If token match fails, reduce α, or fall back to matmul just for that block.

Routing gates
Use drift or cosine similarity during inference to decide in real-time whether to trust a routed path.
